# Personal website

experimenting with building a person site with a static site generator.

1. Run the dev server

```bash
$ yarn start
```

2. Build for production!

```bash
$ yarn build # or react-static build
```

#### Misc

run shell inside of docker container

```
docker exec -it <container id> sh
```
